      <h2>Welcome to my first website!*</h2>
      <h3>My name is Casey, here's a little about me</h3>
      <p>I am a PhD student in the THING Lab in the ATLAS Institute at CU Boulder. I work with Daniel Leithinger (my PI) and the rest of the lab to create and explore the ways people interact with novel user interfaces.</p>
      <p>For example, I work a lot with UHF RFID. This type of RFID is special because it works over long distances. Because of this, it is possible to use it to make battery free embodied interfaces. Cool right?</p>

      <h2>My Goals for this Class</h2>
      <p>My goal for this class is to help start you on your web development journey. This means that I will teach you the basics of web development, like the languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It means I will also be teaching you best practices for structuring your sites to make them look beautiful like design systems and responsive site development.</p>
      <p>During the latter half of the semester, we will also explore ways to help take your site to the next level using outside resources. I will be going over the basics of Bootstrap, a JS library, and also how to use JS APIs to make your websites connect to data from the real world. These basics will help set you up to use more advanced APIs and libraries in the future if you choose to continue your web dev journey.</p>
