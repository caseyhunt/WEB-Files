      <h2>My Goals for this Class</h2>
      <p>My goal for this class is to start you on your web development journey. I will teach you the basics of web development, like the languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It means I will also be teaching you best practices for structuring your sites to make them look beautiful.</p>
      <p>During the latter half of the semester, we will explore ways to take your site to the next level with outside resources. I will be going over how to use JS Libraries and APIs. These basics will help set you up to use more advanced infastructure in the future if you continue your web dev journey.</p>
